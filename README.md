# `computerEngineering`

This repository is an archive of my 2022 class "ECE Computer Engineering" at The University of Tulsa. Though the repository was meant to collect multiple project over the semester, we just did one: designing an Instruction Set Architecture. This can be seen in the `ISA` directory.

It uses a combination of a compiler and an interpreter to run and execute the language I created. Enjoy.
